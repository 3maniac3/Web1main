      i see trees of green
      red roses too
      i see them bloom
      for me and you
      and i think to myself
      what a wonderful world
      
      i see skies of blue
      and clouds of white
      the bright blessed days
      the dark sacred nights
      and i think to myself
      what a wonderful world
      
      the colors of the rainbow
      so pretty in the sky
      are also on the faces
      of people going by
      
      i see friends shaking hands
      saying "how do you do?"
      they're really saying
      "i love you"
      
      i heard babies crying
      i watch them grow
      they'll learn much more
      than i've ever known
      and i think to myself
      what a wonderful world
